## What are Artificial Neural Networks?
An artificial neural network is a system of hardware or software that is patterned after the working of neurones in the human brain and nervous system. Artificial neural networks are a variety of deep learning technology which comes under the broad domain of Artificial Intelligence.

Deep learning is a branch of Machine Learning which uses different types of neural networks. These algorithms are inspired by the way our brain functions and therefore many experts believe they are our best shot to moving towards real AI. Moreover, the performance of neural networks improves as they grow bigger and work with more and more data, unlike other Machine Learning algorithms which can reach a plateau after a point.

## How do Neural Networks work?
A neural network has a large number of processors. These processors operate parallelly but are arranged as tiers. The first tier receives the raw input similar to how the optic nerve receives the raw information in human beings.

Each successive tier then receives input from the tier before it and then passes on its output to the tier after it. The last tier processes the final output.

Small nodes make up each tier. The nodes are highly interconnected with the nodes in the tier before and after. Each node in the neural network has its own sphere of knowledge, including rules that it was programmed with and rules it has learnt by itself.  

The key to the efficacy of neural networks is they are extremely adaptive and learn very quickly. Each node weighs the importance of the input it receives from the nodes before it. The inputs that contribute the most towards the right output are given the highest weight.

## What are the Different Types of Neural Networks?
Different types of neural networks use different principles in determining their own rules. There are many types of artificial neural networks, each with their unique strengths. Here I consider the following types:

* Feedforward Neural Network – Artificial Neurone
* Multilayer Perceptron
* Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
* Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) – Long Short Term Memory
